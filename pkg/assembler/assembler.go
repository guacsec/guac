// NOTE: `GuacNode` and `GuacEdge` interfaces are very experimental and might
// change in the future as we discover issues with reading/writing from the
// graph database.
//
// For now, the design of the interface follows these guidelines:
//
//   1. We want to serialize `GuacNode`s and `GuacEdge`s to graph database
//      (e.g. Neo4j) without creating duplicate nodes. To do this, we need
//      ability to uniquely identify a node. Since a node could be created from
//      different document types, it can be uniquely identified by different
//      subsets of attributes/properties. For example, we could have a node
//      that is identified by an `"id"` field from one document and by the pair
//      `"name"`, `"digest"` from another one.
//   2. Nodes can also have attributes that are not unique and are generated
//      from various documents.
//   3. In order to write the serialization/deserialization code, we need to
//      get the name of the attributes separate from the pairing between the
//      attribute and the value.
//
// In broad lines, the serialization process for a node would look like:
//
//   1. For each identifiable set in `IdentifiablePropertyNames()` check if the
//      node has values for all of the specified properties. If one is missing,
//      try the next set. If no set is left, panic.
//   2. If a set of identifiable properties is found and we have values for all
//      of these, write a query that would match on nodes which have these
//      property:value attributes. The graph database engine will allow us to
//      run separate code if a node already exists or one is newly created. In
//      our case, in both instances we will just need to set the other
//      attributes that have a value. To do this, the `Properties()` returned
//      map will be passed directly to the prepared statement (which uses
//      `Type()` to select the graph database node type and `PropertyNames()`
//      to build the rest of the query).
//
// The serialization process for an edge would be similar, with the caveat that
// an edge is always created between two existing nodes.
//
// Deserialization is left for later, with the only caveat that we might
// envision a case where we'd like to match on edges without first matching on
// their endpoints (e.g., "retrieve all attestations from this time period and
// for each of them return the artifact nodes"). Hence, we need ways to
// uniquely identify edges without having endpoint nodes.
//
// TODO(mihaimaruseac): Look into using tags of fields to automate
// serialization/deserialization, similar to how json is done.
