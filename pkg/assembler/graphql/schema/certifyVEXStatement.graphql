CertifyVEXStatement is an attestation that represents when a package or artifact has a VEX about a specific vulnerability (CVE or GHSA)

subject - union type that represents a package or artifact
vulnerability (object) - union type that consists of cve or ghsa
justification (property) - justification for VEX
knownSince (property) - timestamp of the VEX (exact time in RFC 3339 format)
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
