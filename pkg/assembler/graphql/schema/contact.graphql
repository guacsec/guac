"""
PointOfContact is an attestation of how to get in touch with the person(s) responsible
for a package, source, or artifact.

All evidence trees record a justification for the property they represent as
well as the document that contains the attestation (origin) and the collector
that collected the document (collector).

The attestation applies to a subject which is a package, source, or artifact.
If the attestation targets a package, it must target a PackageName or a
PackageVersion. If the attestation targets a source, it must target a
SourceName.

email is the email address (singular) of the point of contact.

info is additional contact information other than email address. This is free
form.

NOTE: the identifiers for point of contact should be part of software trees.
This will benefit from identifier look up and traversal as well as organization
hierarchy. However, until the use case arises, PointOfContact will be a flat
reference to the contact details.

PointOfContactSpec allows filtering the list of PointOfContact evidence to return in a
query.

If a package is specified in the subject filter, then it must be specified up
to PackageName or PackageVersion. That is, user must specify package name, or
name and one of version, qualifiers, or subpath.

If a source is specified in the subject filter, then it must specify a name,
and optionally a tag and a commit.

since filters attestations with a value of since later or equal to the provided filter.
