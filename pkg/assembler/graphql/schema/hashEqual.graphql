# Defines a GraphQL schema for the HashEqual. It contains the justification, artifacts, origin and collector. 
"""
HashEqual is an attestation that represents when two artifact hash are similar based on a justification.

Justification - string value representing why the artifacts are the equal
Origin - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
Collector - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
Artifacts - the artifacts (represented by algorithm and digest) that are equal

"""
type HashEqual {
  justification: String!
  artifacts: [Artifact!]!
  origin: String!
  collector: String!
}

"""
HashEqualSpec allows filtering the list of HashEqual to return.

Specifying just the artifacts allows to query for all equivalent artifacts (if they exist)
