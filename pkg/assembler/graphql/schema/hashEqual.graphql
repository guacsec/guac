"""
HashEqual is an attestation that represents when two artifact hash are similar based on a justification.

artifacts (subject) - the artifacts (represented by algorithm and digest) that are equal
justification (property) - string value representing why the artifacts are the equal
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation

"""
HashEqualSpec allows filtering the list of HashEqual to return.

Specifying just the artifacts allows to query for all equivalent artifacts (if they exist)
