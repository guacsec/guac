"""
CertifyBad is an attestation represents when a package, source or artifact is considered bad

subject - union type that can be either a package, source or artifact object type
justification (property) - string value representing why the subject is considered bad
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation

Note: Attestation must occur at the PackageName or the PackageVersion or at the SourceName.

"""
CertifyBadSpec allows filtering the list of CertifyBad to return.
Note: Package, Source or artifact must be specified but not at the same time
For package - a PackageName or PackageVersion must be specified (name or name, version, qualifiers and subpath)
For source - a SourceName must be specified (name, tag or commit)
