CertifyBad is an attestation that a package, source, or artifact is considered
bad.

All evidence trees record a justification for the property they represent as
well as the document that contains the attestation (origin) and the collector
that collected the document (collector).

The certification applies to a subject which is a package, source, or artifact.
If the attestation targets a package, it must target a PackageName or a
PackageVersion. If the attestation targets a source, it must target a
SourceName.

CertifyBadSpec allows filtering the list of CertifyBad evidence to return in a
query.

If a package is specified in the subject filter, then it must be specified up
to PackageName or PackageVersion. That is, user must specify package name, or
name and one of version, qualifiers, or subpath.

If a source is specified in the subject filter, then it must specify a name,
and optionally a tag and a commit.

If KnownSince is specified, the returned value will be after or equal to the specified time.
