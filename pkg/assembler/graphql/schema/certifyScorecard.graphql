"""
CertifyScorecard is an attestation represents the scorecard of a particular source

Source - the source object type that represents the source
timeScanned - timestamp when this was last scanned (exact time)
aggregateScore - overall scorecard score for the source
checks - individual scorecard check scores (Branch-Protection, Code-Review...etc)
scorecardVersion - version of the scorecard when the source was scanned
scorecardCommit - commit of scorecard when the source was scanned
Origin - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
Collector - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
