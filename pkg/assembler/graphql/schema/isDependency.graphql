IsDependency is an attestation that represents when a package is dependent on another package

package (subject) - the package object type that represents the package
dependentPackage (object) - the package object type that represents the packageName (cannot be to the packageVersion)
versionRange (property) - string value for version range that applies to the dependent package
justification (property) - string value representing why the artifacts are the equal
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
