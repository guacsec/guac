# Defines a GraphQL schema for the package trie/tree. This tree closely matches
# the pURL specification (https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/0dd92f26f8bb11956ffdf5e8acfcee71e8560407/README.rst)
# but deviates from it where GUAC rules state otherwise. In principle, we want
# this to represent a trie for packages, so information that represents a
# smaller collection of packages is being pushed downwards in the trie.

"""
Package represents a package.

In the pURL representation, each Package matches a `pkg:<type>` partial pURL.
The `type` field matches the pURL types but we might also use `"guac"` for the
cases where the pURL representation is not complete or when we have custom
rules.

This node is a singleton: backends guarantee that there is exactly one node with
the same `type` value.

Also note that this is named `Package`, not `PackageType`. This is only to make
queries more readable.
"""
type Package {
  type: String!
  namespaces: [PackageNamespace!]!
}

"""
PackageNamespace is a namespace for packages.

In the pURL representation, each PackageNamespace matches the
`pgk:<type>/<namespace>/` partial pURL.

Namespaces are optional and type specific. Because they are optional, we use
empty string to denote missing namespaces.
"""
type PackageNamespace {
  namespace: String!
  names: [PackageName!]!
}

"""
PackageName is a name for packages.

In the pURL representation, each PackageName matches the
`pgk:<type>/<namespace>/<name>` pURL.

Names are always mandatory.

This is the first node in the trie that can be referred to by other parts of
GUAC.
"""
type PackageName {
  name: String!
  versions: [PackageVersion!]!
}

"""
PackageVersion is a package version.

In the pURL representation, each PackageName matches the
`pgk:<type>/<namespace>/<name>@<version>` pURL.

Versions are optional and each Package type defines own rules for handling them.
For this level of GUAC, these are just opaque strings.

This node can be referred to by other parts of GUAC.
"""
type PackageVersion {
  version: String!
  qualifiers: [PackageQualifier!]!
}

"""
PackageQualifier is a qualifier for a package, a key-value pair.

In the pURL representation, it is a part of the `<qualifiers>` part of the
`pgk:<type>/<namespace>/<name>@<version>?<qualifiers>` pURL.

Qualifiers are optional, each Package type defines own rules for handling them,
and multiple qualifiers could be attached to the same package.

This node cannot be directly referred by other parts of GUAC.
"""
type PackageQualifier {
  key: String!
  value: String!
}

"""
PkgSpec allows filtering the list of packages to return.

Each field matches a qualifier from pURL. Use `null` to match on all values at
that level. For example, to get all packages in GUAC backend, use a PkgSpec
where every field is `null`.

Empty string at a field means matching with the empty string. If passing in
qualifiers, all of the values in the list must match.
"""
input PkgSpec {
  type: String
  namespace: String
  name: String
  version: String
  qualifiers: [PackageQualifierInput!]
}

"""
PackageQualifierInput is the same as PackageQualifier, but usable as query
input.

GraphQL does not allow input types to contain composite types and does not allow
composite types to contain input types. So, although in this case these two
types are semantically the same, we have to duplicate the definition.

Keys are mandatory, but values could also be `null` if we want to match all
values for a specific key.

input PackageQualifierInput {
  key: String!
  value: String
}

extend type Query {
  "Returns all packages"
  packages(pkgSpec: PkgSpec): [Package!]!
