CertifyVuln is an attestation that represents when a package has a vulnerability

package (subject) - the package object type that represents the package
vulnerability (object) - union type that consists of osv, cve or ghsa
timeScanned (property) - timestamp of when the package was last scanned
dbUri (property) - scanner vulnerability database uri
dbVersion (property) - scanner vulnerability database version
scannerUri (property) - vulnerability scanner's uri 
scannerVersion (property) - vulnerability scanner version
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
