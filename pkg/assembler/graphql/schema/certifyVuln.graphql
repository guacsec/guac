Either noVuln must be set or exactly one of osv, cve or ghsa

there is no vulnerability attached. Setting it to false means retrieving only nodes
with identified vulnerabilities. Setting one of the other fields means retrieving
certifications for the corresponding vulnerability types.

vulnerabilities, so the special NoVuln node will be used by the backend.
