"""
IsOccurrence is an attestation represents when either a package or source is represented by an artifact

subject - union type that can be either a package or source object type
occurrenceArtifacts (object) - list of artifacts that represent the the package or source
justification (property) - string value representing why the package or source is represented by the specified artifact
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation

Note: Package or Source must be specified but not both at the same time.
Attestation must occur at the PackageName or the PackageVersion or at the SourceName.

IsOccurrence does not connect a package with a source. 
HasSourceAt attestation will be used to connect a package with a source
