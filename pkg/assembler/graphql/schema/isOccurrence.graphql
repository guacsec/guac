IsOccurrence is an attestation represents when either a package or source is represented by an artifact
Justification - string value representing why the package or source is represented by the specified artifact
Package - the package object type that represents the package
Source - the source object type that represents the source

source - 
Collector - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
Origin - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)

Note: Package or Source must be specified but not both at the same time
HasSourceAt attestation will be used to connect a package with a source
