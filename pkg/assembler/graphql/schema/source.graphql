"""
Source represents a source.

This can be the version control system that is being used.

This node is a singleton: backends guarantee that there is exactly one node with
the same `type` value.

Also note that this is named `Source`, not `SourceType`. This is only to make
queries more readable.
"""
type Source {
  type: String!
  namespaces: [SourceNamespace!]!
}

"""
SourceNamespace is a namespace for sources.

This can be represented as the location of the repo (such as github/gitlab/bitbucket)

Namespaces are optional and type specific. Because they are optional, we use
empty string to denote missing namespaces.
"""
type SourceNamespace {
  namespace: String!
  names: [SourceName!]!
}

"""
SourceName is a url of the repository.

SourceName is mandatory.

This is the first node in the trie that can be referred to by other parts of
GUAC.
"""
type SourceName {
  name: String!
  qualifiers: [SourceQualifier!]!
}

"""
SourceQualifier containers the commit or tag.

Either a tag or commit needs to be specified.

This node can be referred to by other parts of GUAC.
"""
type SourceQualifier {
  tag: String!
  commit: String!
}

"""
PkgSpec allows filtering the list of packages to return.

Each field matches a qualifier from pURL. Use `null` to match on all values at
that level. For example, to get all packages in GUAC backend, use a PkgSpec
where every field is `null`.

Empty string at a field means matching with the empty string.
"""
input SourceSpec {
  type: String
  namespace: String
  name: String
  qualifier: SourceQualifierInput
}

"""
SourceQualifierInput is the same as SourceQualifier, but usable as query
input.
"""
input SourceQualifierInput {
  tag: String
  commit: String
}

extend type Query {
  "Returns all sources"
  sources(sourceSpec: SourceSpec): [Source!]!
