OSV represents an Open Source Vulnerability.

We create a separate node to allow retrieving all OSVs.

OSVId is the actual ID that is given to a specific vulnerability.

The `osvId` field is mandatory and canonicalized to be lowercase.

This maps to a vulnerability ID specific to the environment (e.g., GHSA ID or
CVE ID).

This node can be referred to by other parts of GUAC.
