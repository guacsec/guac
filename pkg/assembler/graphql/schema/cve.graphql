CVE represents common vulnerabilities and exposures. It contains the year along
with the CVE ID.

The year is mandatory.

This node is a singleton: backends guarantee that there is exactly one node
with the same `year` value.

CVEId is the actual ID that is given to a specific vulnerability

The `id` field is mandatory and canonicalized to be lowercase.

This node can be referred to by other parts of GUAC.
