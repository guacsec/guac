# Defines a GraphQL schema for a vulnerability in CVE schema

"""
CVE represents a vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
schema.

The vulnerability identifier contains a year field, so we are extracting that
to allow matching for vulnerabilities found in a given year.

The vulnerability identifier field is mandatory and canonicalized to be
lowercase.

This node can be referred to by other parts of GUAC.
