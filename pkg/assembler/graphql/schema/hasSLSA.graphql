HasSLSA is an attestation represents that the subject has a SLSA attestation associated with it.

subject - an union type that consists of package, source or artifact
builtFrom (object) - list of union types that consists of the package, source or artifact that the subject was build from
builtBy (object) - represents the builder that was used to build the subject
buildType (property) - individual scorecard check scores (Branch-Protection, Code-Review...etc)
slsaPredicate (property) - a list of key value pair that consist of the keys and values of the SLSA predicate
slsaVersion (property) - version of the SLSA predicate
startedOn (property) - timestamp when the SLSA predicate was recorded during the build time of the subject (in RFC 3339 format)
finishedOn (property) - timestamp when the SLSA predicate was completed during the build time of the subject (in RFC 3339 format)
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
