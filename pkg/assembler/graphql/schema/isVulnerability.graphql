IsVulnerability is an attestation that represents when an OSV ID represents a CVE or GHSA

OSV - the osv object type that represents OSV and its ID
Vulnerability - union type that consists of cve or ghsa
Justification - the reason why the osv ID represents the cve or ghsa
Origin - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
Collector - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation
