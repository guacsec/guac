HasSBOM is an attestation represents that a package object or source object has an SBOM associated with a uri

subject - union type that can be either a package or source object type
uri (property) - identifier string for the SBOM
origin (property) - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
collector (property) - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation

Note: Only package object or source object can be defined. Not both.

HashEqualSpec allows filtering the list of HasSBOM to return.

Only the package or source can be added, not both. HasSourceAt will be used to create the package to source
relationship.
