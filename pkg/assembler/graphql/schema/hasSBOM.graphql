HasSBOM is an attestation represents that a package object or source object has an SBOM associated with a uri

Package - the package object type that represents the package
Source - the source object type that represents the source
uri - identifier string for the SBOM
Origin - where this attestation was generated from (based on which document)
Collector - the GUAC collector that collected the document that generated this attestation

Note: Only package object or source object can be defined. Not both.
