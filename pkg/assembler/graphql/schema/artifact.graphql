# Defines a GraphQL schema for the artifact

"""
Artifact represents an artifact identified by a checksum hash.

The checksum is split into the digest value and the algorithm used to generate
it. Both fields are mandatory and canonicalized to be lowercase.

If having a checksum Go object, algorithm can be
strings.ToLower(string(checksum.Algorithm)) and digest can be checksum.Value.

ArtifactSpec allows filtering the list of artifacts to return in a query.

The checksum fields are canonicalized to be lowercase.
