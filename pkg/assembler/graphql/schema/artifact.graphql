# Defines a GraphQL schema for the artifact

"""
Artifact represents an artifact identified by a checksum hash.

The checksum is split into the digest value and the algorithm used to generate
it. Both fields are mandatory and canonicalized to be lowercase.

If having a checksum Go object, algorithm can be
strings.ToLower(string(checksum.Algorithm)) and digest can be checksum.Value.
"""
type Artifact {
  id: ID!
  algorithm: String!
  digest: String!
}

"""
ArtifactSpec allows filtering the list of artifacts to return in a query.

The checksum fields are canonicalized to be lowercase.
"""
input ArtifactSpec {
  id: ID
  algorithm: String
  digest: String
}

"""
ArtifactInputSpec specifies an artifact for mutations.

The checksum fields are canonicalized to be lowercase.
"""
input ArtifactInputSpec {
  algorithm: String!
  digest: String!
}

"""
IDorArtifactInput allows for specifying either the artifact ID or the ArtifactInputSpec.

Either the ID or the ArtifactInputSpec must be specified. Both cannot be nil.

If the ID is specified, the ArtifactInputSpec is not used.
"""
input IDorArtifactInput {
  artifactID: ID
  artifactInput: ArtifactInputSpec

"""
ArtifactConnection returns the paginated results for artifact.

totalCount is the total number of results returned.

pageInfo provides information to the client if there is
a next or previous page of results and the starting and
ending cursor for the current set.

edges contains the ArtifactsEdge which contains the current cursor
and the artifact node itself
