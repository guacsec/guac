"""
Node is a union type of all the possible nodes.

It encapsulates the software tree nodes along with the evidence nodes. In a
path query, all connecting evidence nodes along with their intermediate subject
nodes need to be returned in order to create a complete graph.

Edge allows filtering path/neighbors output to only contain a subset of all
possible GUAC links.

Each member of the enum is formed by merging two Node names with _. Each name
is converted from CamelCase to CAPITALS_WITH_UNDERSCORES. Only valid edges
(pairs from Node to Node) are included.

The only exception to the above rule is for links out of HasSLSA. The names are
HAS_SLSA_SUBJECT, HAS_SLSA_BUILT_BY, and HAS_SLSA_MATERIALS. This is because
ARTIFACT_HAS_SLSA is only from subject Artifact to HasSLSA.
