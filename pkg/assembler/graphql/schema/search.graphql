  findSoftware takes in a searchText string and looks for software
  that may be relevant for the input text. This can be seen as fuzzy search
  function for Packages, Sources and Artifacts. findSoftware returns a list
  of Packages, Sources and Artifacts that it determines to be relevant to
  the input searchText.

  Due to the nature of full text search being implemented differently on
  different db platforms, the behavior of findSoftware is not guaranteed
  to be the same. In addition, their statistical nature may result in
  results being different per call and not reproducible.

  All that is asked in the implementation of this API is that it follows
  the spirit of helping to retrieve the right nodes with best effort.

  Warning: This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature. This is subject to change.
  Warning: This is an OPTIONAL feature. Backends are not required to
  implement this API.
