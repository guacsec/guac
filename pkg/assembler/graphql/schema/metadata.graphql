# Defines a GraphQL schema for the HasMetadata

"""
HasMetadata is an attestation that a package, source, or artifact has a certain
attested property (key) with value (value). For example, a source may have
metadata "SourceRepo2FAEnabled=true". 

The intent of this evidence tree predicate is to allow extensibility of metadata
expressible within the GUAC ontology. Metadata that is commonly used will then
be promoted to a predicate on its own.

Justification indicates how the metadata was determined.

The metadata applies to a subject which is a package, source, or artifact.
If the attestation targets a package, it must target a PackageName or a
PackageVersion. If the attestation targets a source, it must target a
SourceName.
