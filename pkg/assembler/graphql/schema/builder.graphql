# Defines a GraphQL schema for the builder. It only contains the uri
"""
Builder represents the builder such as (FRSCA or github actions) and contains a uri field

uri is mandatory and represents the specific builder.

This node is a singleton: backends guarantee that there is exactly one node with
the same `uri` value.
"""
type Builder {
  uri: String!
}

"""
BuilderSpec allows filtering the list of builders to return.
"""
input BuilderSpec {
  uri: String
}
