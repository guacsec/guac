# Defines a GraphQL schema for the vulnerability trie/tree

"""
Vulnerability represents the root of the vulnerability trie/tree.

We map vulnerability information to a trie, as a derivative of the pURL specification:
each path in the trie represents a type and a vulnerability ID. This allows for generic
representation of the various vulnerabilities and does not limit to just cve, ghsa or osv. 
This would be in the general format: vuln://<general-type>/<vuln-id>

Examples:

CVE, using path separator: vuln://cve/cve-2023-20753
OSV, representing its knowledge of a GHSA: vuln://osv/ghsa-205hk
Random vendor: vuln://snyk/sn-whatever


This node represents the type part of the trie path. It is used to represent
the specific type of the vulnerability: cve, ghsa, osv or some other vendor specific

Since this node is at the root of the vulnerability trie, it is named Vulnerability, not
VulnerabilityType.
"""
type Vulnerability {
  id: ID!
  type: String!
  vulnerabilityIDs: [VulnerabilityID!]!
}

"""
VulnerabilityID is a specific vulnerability ID associated with the type of the vulnerability.

This will be enforced to be all lowercase.

The namespace field is mandatory.
"""
type VulnerabilityID {
  id: ID!
  vulnerabilityID: String!
}

"""
NoVuln is a special vulnerability node to attest that no vulnerability has been
found during a vulnerability scan.

Backends guarantee that this is a singleton node.
"""
type NoVuln {
  id: ID!
}

"""
VulnerabilitySpec allows filtering the list of vulnerabilities to return in a query.

Use null to match on all values at that level. 
For example, to get all vulnerabilities in GUAC backend, use a VulnSpec
where every field is null.

"""
input VulnerabilitySpec {
  id: ID
  type: String
  vulnerabilityID: String
}

"""
VulnInputSpec specifies a vulnerability for mutations.

This is different than VulnSpec because we want to encode mandatory fields:
type and vulnerabilityID.
"""
input VulnerabilityInputSpec {
  type: String!
  vulnerabilityID: String!
}

extend type Query {
  "Returns all vulnerabilities matching a filter."
  vulnerabilities(vulnSpec: VulnerabilitySpec!): [Vulnerability!]!
}

extend type Mutation {
  "Ingests a new vulnerability and returns the corresponding vulnerability trie path."
  ingestVulnerability(vuln: VulnerabilityInputSpec!): Vulnerability!
  "Bulk ingests vulnerabilities and returns the list of corresponding vulnerability trie path."
  ingestVulnerabilities(vulns: [VulnerabilityInputSpec!]!): [Vulnerability!]!
}
