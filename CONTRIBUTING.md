We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Refer to the [Developer Setup](./SETUP.md) document to learn how to prepare your

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
