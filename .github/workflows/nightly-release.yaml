# This workflow requires a GitHub App to be registered and installed at the 
# GitHub Org or personal account level which provides the permissions needed
# to trigger nightly releases. See details at 
# https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/making-authenticated-api-requests-with-a-github-app-in-a-github-actions-workflow.
# Note that the GitHub App must grant read/write permissions on Contents.
# This is needed because the inbuilt GITHUB_TOKEN will not trigger a new workflow
# and we don't want to independently create and manage a bot account -
# see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow.
